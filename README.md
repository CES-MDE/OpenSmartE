# OpenSmartE
The open-source version of Smart-E UEM tool (http://www.ces.mines-paristech.fr/Logiciels/Smart-E/)

Smart-E is a bottom-up simulation platform designed to evaluate energy efficiency strategies. Databases and simple physical and probabilistic models are used to simulate the main energy uses in dwellings or buildings. All algorithms are written with Python programming language and Numpy+Pandas Packages
ref : Berthou et al., SMART-E: A TOOL FOR ENERGY DEMAND SIMULATION AN OPTIMIZATION AT THE CITY SCALE, 2015 http://www.ibpsa.org/proceedings/BS2015/p2155.pdf

Today only few functions are available in open source since we need to clean the code and validate " defaults parameterization"
